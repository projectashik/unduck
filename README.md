# Cban Search

DuckDuckGo's bang redirects are too slow. Add the following URL as a custom search engine to your browser. Enables all of DuckDuckGo's bangs to work, but much faster.

```
https://search.cban.top?q=%s
```

## How is it that much faster?

DuckDuckGo does their redirects server side. Their DNS is...not always great. Result is that it often takes ages.
